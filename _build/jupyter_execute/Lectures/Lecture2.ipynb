    "## Definition of a group\n",
    "\n",
    "We start our adventure with groups and representations by defining what we mean by a group. There are two main ingredients in this definition: a group is a set with a (binary) operation defined on it. This means if we take two elements of the set, we can 'multiply' them and obtain another element of the same set. Not all sets with binary operations define groups, the operation needs to satisfy additional conditions. In particular, we often want to define more than two elements, and therefore we need to define what we mean by this, for example introducing appropriate brackets, such that at any stage we multiply only two elements at the time. For a binary operation to be a group multiplication, we demand that the operation is associative, which means that the result of multiplying more than two things does not depend on the way in which we put the brackets. Moreover, we demand that there is an identity element of the binary operation, which is an element that does not change the value of other elements when multiplied. Finally, every element should have an inverse element. A formal definition is given below:\n",
