For example, the one dimensional subspace spanned by $e_1+e_2+e_3+e_4$ is fixed by $D_4$ -- when $D_4$ acts, it permutes $e_i$ so their sum remains unchanged. Therefore, for all $g\\in D_4$, we have \n",

When $D_4$ acts by permutinf the coordinates, it leaves their sum unchanged, For example, $B$ sends $(1,2,3,-6)$ to $(-6,3,2,1)$ if vectors are labelled counterclockwise from the upper right. The space $W$ is a three-dimensional representation of $D_4$ on $\\mathbb{R}^4$.

To find interesting subrepresentations of $V$, we can look for non-zero vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ whose orbits under the action of $D_4$ span proper subspaces of $V$. One way is to find vectors with small orbits. For example, the vector $(1,1,1,1)$ is fixed by $D_4$. It spans a one-dimensional subrepresentation of $V$ where $D_4$ acts trivially.\n",

    "Another vector with a small orbit is $w=(-1,1,-1,1)$. Note that $A$ acts on $w$ to produce $(1,-1,1,-1)=-w$. Also the reflection $B$ acts the same way and produces $-w$. All other elements of $D_4$ act by superpositions of these two elements, and therefore the orbit of $w$ is just $\\{w,-w\\}$. Thus the one-dimensional subspace spanned by $w$ is a subrepresentation of $V$. This is not a trivial representation since some elements act by the multiplication by $-1$.\n",
