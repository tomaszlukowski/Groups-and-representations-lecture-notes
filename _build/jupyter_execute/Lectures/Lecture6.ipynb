    "## Classification of irreducible representations of finite groups\n",

    "In this part of the module we want to find all irreducible representaions for finite groups, with special emphasis on symmetric groups $S_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the starting point, let us try to classify all representations of $S_2$ over complex numbers. Suppose that $V$ is a complex representation of $S_2$. The group $S_2$ is generated by one element $\\sigma=(12)$ and therefore to find subrepresentations of $V$ it is sufficient to find subspaces of $V$ that are invariant under the action of $\\sigma$. First considedr the action of $\\sigma$ on $V$. Let $v$ be an eigenvector of this action, with the eigenvalue $\\theta$. Then the subspace spanned by $v$ is invariant under the action of $S_2$, and therefore all representations of $S_2$ must be one-dimensional. Moreover, since $\\sigma^2$ is the identity element of $A_2$, then $\\theta^2=1$ which imples that $\\theta=\\pm 1$. There are only two irreducible complex representations of $S_2$:\n",
    "- when $\\theta=1$ then we get the trivial representation\n",
    "- when $\\theta=-1$ then we get the alternating representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform a similar calculation for $S_3$. The group $S_3$ is generated by $\\sigma=(123)$ and $\\tau=(12)$. Let $V$ be a complex representation of $S_3$, then we need to find all subspaces of $V$ invariant under the action of both $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$. Let $v$ be the eigenvector for the action of $\\sigma$, with the eigenvalue $\\theta$. Let $w-\\tau.v$. Because we know that $\\tau \\sigma\\tau=\\sigma^2$ in $S_3$ then\n",

    "$$\n",

    "and therefore $w$ is also an eigenvector of $\\sigma$ with the eigenvalue $\\theta^2$. It follows that the subspace generated by $v$ and $w$ is invariant under $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$, hence under all of $S_3$. In particular, an irreducible complex representation of $S_3$ over the complex numbers can have dimension no hogher than two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that $V$ is irreducible. Since $\\sigma^2$ is the identity element of $S_3$, the eigenvalue $\\theta$ must satisfy $\\theta^3=1$. There are two cases to consider:\n",
    "- $\\theta=1$. Then $w=v$ because otherwise the subspace spanned by $v+w$ would be a one-dimensional invariant subspace of $V$, and therefore $V$ would not be irreducible. Then $V$ is one-dimensional and we know that $\\sigma$ acts triviall on it. Now, since $\\tau^=e$ we have only two options:\n",

    " - $\\tau$ acts as $-1$: $V$ is the alternating representation\n",
    "- $\\theta\\neq 1$. In this case $\\theta\\neq \\theta^2$, so the vectors $v$ and $w$ have distinct eigenvalues $\\theta$ and $\\theta^2$. Moreover, since $\\theta^3=1$ ther $\\theta^2+\\theta+1=0$. Then, the map\n",
