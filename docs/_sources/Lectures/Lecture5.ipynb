All other elements of $D_4$ act by superpositions of these two elements, and therefore the orbit of $w$ is just $\\{w,-w\\}$. Thus the one-dimensional subspace spanned by $w$ is a subrepresentation of $V$. This is not a trivial representation since some elements act by the multiplication by $-1$.\n",
